## Overview

Started out as a fun little challenge to write a connect four class in vanilla js.

The initial stack was just `js`, `jest`, `eslint`, `prettier` and `husky`.

The intent was to just code without overthinking the setup and structures. Then I can continually iterate on the app by adding technologies I'd like to practice with.

## Getting started

### Create `.env` file

Currently used for local development.

Copy an example env and modify as needed.

### Install dependencies:

`npm i`

### Start the api:

**Runs app from `src`**
`npm start`

**Alias for `npm start`**
`npm start:dev`

**Builds app and runs from `dist`**
`npm run start:build`

### Other scripts:

| Script           | Description     |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `npm test`       | Runs jest tests |
| `npm run lint`   | Runs eslint     |
| `npm run format` | Runs prettier   |
| `npm run build`  | Compiles app    |

## Swagger Docs

Can access endpoint documentation by going to `http://localhost:3000/swagger` whilst the app is running.
