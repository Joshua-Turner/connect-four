# Connect four experiment

Starting out as a fun little challenge to write a connect four class in vanilla js. Initially without even a view layer but rather unit tests and sloppy code.

I'm hoping to keep implementing more into this exercise perhaps implementing an api to call then perhaps something with websockets. Who knows?
